Modern climbing assistance systems allow defining routes using external devices.
This makes the training process unintuitive.
We believe such a system should be able to autonomously record and identify routes by observing the climber.
The difficulty here is to provide a reliable detection of the holds grabbed.
We tackle this issue using a hybrid approach:
First, we use the Myo muscle tracker to determine when a hold was grabbed.
Second, we analyze the visual data given by Beta-Cube to match the position of the hand with the closest hold.
Evaluating this technique showed that it was able to reliably detect grabbed holds.
Furthermore, our system allows deleting previously grabbed holds by utilizing gestures detected by the Myo.
