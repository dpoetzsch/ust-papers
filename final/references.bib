    abstract = {Today, sports and activity trackers are ubiquitous. Especially runners and cyclists have a variety of possibilities to record and analyze their workouts. In contrast, climbing did not find much attention in consumer electronics and human-computer interaction. If quantified data similar to cycling or running data were available for climbing, several applications would be possible, ranging from simple training diaries to virtual coaches or usage analytics for gym operators. This paper introduces a system that automatically recognizes climbed routes using wrist-worn inertia measurement units (IMUs). This is achieved by extracting features of a recorded ascent and use them as training data for the recognition system. To verify the recognition system, cross-validation methods were applied to a set of ascent recordings that were assessed during a user study with eight climbers in a local climbing gym. The evaluation resulted in a high recognition rate, thus proving that our approach is possible and operational. },

    abstract = {In rock climbing, discussing climbing techniques with others to master a specific route getting practical advice from more experienced climbers is an inherent part of the culture and tradition of the sport. Spatial information, such as the position of holds, as well as learning complex body postures plays a major role in this process. A typical problem that occurs during advising, is an alignment effect when trying to picture orientation-specific knowledge, e.g. explaining how to perform a certain self-climbed move to others. We propose betaCube, a self-calibrating camera-projection unit that features 3D tracking and distortion-free projection. The system enables a life-sized video replay and climbing route creation using augmented reality. We contribute an interface for automatic setup of mobile and distortion free projection, blob detection for climbing holds, as well as an automatic method for extracting planar trackables from artificial climbing walls. },
