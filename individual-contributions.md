On the technical part I was responsible for the communication between the Myo server and the betaCube.
This included defining a protocol,
    setting up a C++-TCP-Server with an easy-to-use API to send grab and delete events,
    and setting up a C#-TCP-Client with an easy-to-use listener interface for the betaCube. 
Also, I intensively worked with Felix on trying to stabilize the offset calculation that enables us to get rid of the colored wristbands.

During field testing I was usually responsible for climbing the route over and over again
    and actively helped debugging the betaCube.

For the proposal I drafted the abstract, introduction and goals section and polished the whole thing together with my team mates.
For the final report I drafted the abstract, introduction, evaluation, conclusion and parts of the implementation section.
I also helped finalizing the report after all drafts were written.
Together with my team I helped structuring, designing and holding our presentations.

Finally, I felt responsible for basic project and team management (including setting up infrastructure, organising meetings, etc.).
However, this was not a hard task, as in my opinion our team was working together very well.
