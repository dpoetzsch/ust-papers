\todo{Describe our approach in detail --> ANNA}\\
We are going to combine image analysis with muscle tracking to provide the technology that will allow climbers to define routes simply by climbing it.
The betaCube is a system that includes a 3D camera, a projector and a processing unit.
The betaCube uses image analysis approach and it will give us a general overview of a climbing wall and the location of holds.
It can also match the position of hands and feet to holds on the wall but only if holds are not concealed by a climber.
We will try to improve accuracy of route recognition by using muscle tracker in addition to existing technology.
Muscle tracker measures electrical activity from muscles and therefore can show whether a hold was actually used.
By combining muscular tracking with image analysis we will provide more reliable way of definig route than image analysis alone.
